Thanks to James for [Hello World PWA](https://github.com/jamesjohnson280/hello-pwa) and [this article](https://medium.com/james-johnson/a-simple-progressive-web-app-tutorial-f9708e5f2605), which helped me get started on an installable PWA.
Thanks to Sadrul for the [Chrome vector icon extension](https://github.com/sadrulhc/vector-icons) containing all the critical JS code for rendering icons.
